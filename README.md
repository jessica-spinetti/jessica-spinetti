<b>Hi, I'm Jessica</b>
<hr> </hr>

I graduated from WNE with a computer science degree and a minor in computer forensics in 2021. I am currently learning web development and everything that entails,
from HTML and CSS, to content creation and marketing. With the world of technology constantly changing, I am always looking to expand my knowledge and skill in all 
things tech. This page is my workspace to explore hands on application of HTML, CSS, and online portfolio creation.
